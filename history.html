                    We as humans have since ancient times treated our dead with reverence. However, how we as humans have shown our respect for bodies has changed a lot since then.

                        In ancient Egypt, autopsy was part of the process of mummification. The concept of preserving the body for the afterlife was their main goal and the process involved harvesting the organs and drying the rest of the body. This can be considered to be the earliest place where humans got a good understanding of the inside of the body.  <br /> <br />
                        It was not until 500-300 BC, we found what some of us would consider the foundation of modern medicine. The Greek Doctor Hippocrates is considered the “father of medicine” by many. His view on sickness not being caused by curses or spiritual reasons lays the foundation for observing and learning from symptoms. And how a doctor should avoid speculating without any clear evidence and observe the patient in their bed. The work that is associated with him focuses on how a patient should have a healthy diet and how a doctor should uphold certain ethics around their profession. Today his most influential legacy is the “Hippocratic Oath” which is used by many medical facilities, where newly graduated doctors swear this oath on their graduation. Although it isn’t considered legally binding, it is an ethical ideal that they still swear today to uphold in their profession. The oath sets the basis that a doctor should not harm or discriminate against the sick and that they shall keep the information a patient shares confidential.  <br /> <br />
                        It is also in the period of 500 BC that the medical field rediscovered the interest in autopsy. Many cultures practice the dissection of animals, either in the practice of butchering or in spiritual rituals, like predicting the future or seeking answers. The Roman doctor Galenos from Pergamon (129-210 BC) started his career as a doctor for gladiators in the arena, and he made several discoveries through vivisections, the practice of cutting into live flesh, on animals and on how a body and its organs function. Studying animals was in many ways the easiest way to study the living body. This is also why this exhibit has a comparative anatomical collection of animal skeletons on display.  <br /> <br />
                        For many centuries, the act of dissecting a human body was seen as a desecration of the body. It was for many societies a taboo and many practitioners within the medical field did their research in secret. Especially within religious context, the body should remain whole to be access the afterlife in Greek, roman and Egyptians culture.

                        The Middle Ages was in many ways a regression of medical knowledge within the medical fields. Religion frowned upon desecrating bodies and most of the practice was based upon the holistic theory of “Humorism.” The idea of human health was based on the balance of four fluids inside the body. These were blood, mucus, yellow bile and black bile. Sickness was seen as not affecting an organ, but the entire body, causing an unbalance of the fluids.4  
                        But an understanding of the body was necessary and, in many places, and times, the act of dissecting a body was frowned upon during this early period. The act of getting hold of a body and storing it in the Middle Ages was difficult and, in many cases, hard to do legally. So public shows were done when doctors were allowed to have access to a body. In Italy, King Fredrik II decided that there should be a public dissection of a body for doctors and surgeons every fifth year for learning purposes in 1238.5

                        The Renaissance lasted between the 15th and 16th centuries, and for the medical field it is characteristic of a period of renewed interest in ancient Greek medical texts. It created new interest in empirical science and to better understand how sickness and how the body functioned. Collections and texts by Aristotle and especially Galenos became popular in European society. The invention of the printing press made these medical texts more available for the people and translated them for better understanding. Galenos work on dissecting animals gave a better understanding of the body's function but also created a larger need to study the human body. In the pursuit of knowledge, the need to dissect the human body became more important. In many ways, the taboo about desecrating the human body was lessened by the scientists in their need to understand. Public houses and theatres were erected to house the display of dissections and medical practitioners, scientists and even artists attended these visual displays.  <br /> <br />
                        These displays were vital for people to at the time get a better empirical understanding and also remove the taboo and fear of death. Galenos texts were discussed but also disproven when these studies were done. These acts of studying the human body had a great influence on the culture at the time. We can see that the focus on the human body is reflected in art, but also in philosophy. Only a few people can say they haven’t seen the anatomical drawing “Vitruvian Man” by Leonardo da Vinci. The focus on muscles and how the human body can move becomes a main teaching in art. New detailed illustrations and books were published to teach and help with learning. The increased interest in the medical field created a need for more bodies, and since it was difficult to store bodies to prevent decay outside of the winter, the need for fresh bodies became a valuable source for clear information.  <br /> <br />
                        The 18th – 19th century had issues with body snatchers because of the growing need for access to fresh bodies. The established legal way of acquiring bodies consisted of doctors or hospitals acquiring the bodies of executed criminals, and by this time the demand for bodies had outpaced the supply at hand. So, anatomy professors, surgeons, and medical students were willing to pay for bodies through illegal ways to advance their studies and understanding. This created a market for people to steal bodies. In England stealing bodies wasn’t seen as an official crime until the “Anatomy Act” of 1883.6 A body didn’t have any legal rights and didn’t belong to anyone, so body snatchers found ways to acquire bodies through digging up graves or in some cases murdering people. By leaving the bodies, clothes and valuables at the grave, it wasn’t seen as graverobbing. It is assumed that the majority of the bodies used for medical research through the 18th and 19th centuries were bought from body snatchers.7 What ended this practice was new advancement within embalming, allowing hospitals to preserve bodies from decaying, by making them sterile while being stored.

                        In more modern times, the dissection of the human body has become one of the important ways for medical students to learn about the body. And the ethical framework in how society perceives the human body after its death continues to change. The earlier taboo about cutting into bodies seems to have lessened and the need for the body to remain whole after death has also become a less important part of many cultures. Donating one’s body to the medical field is no longer seen as a punishment for executed criminals, but a gift given freely from the patient to the hospital to help medical students learn and save lives. It is a gift that the medical field should be thankful and fortunate to receive from generous donors.  <br /> <br />
                        Organ transplantation is also something we could consider new within the medical field. The world’s first organ transplantation happened in 1954, with a 23-year-old man receiving his twin brother’s kidney after suffering from kidney failure.  Norway had its first successful organ transplant surgery in 1963. The next few decades have shown several advancements within organ transplantation and a greater awareness of the subject of organ donation to save and improve lives.
