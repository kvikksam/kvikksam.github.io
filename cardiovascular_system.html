                        Your cardiovascular system has several tasks, among these the most known is probably transport of oxygen and nutrients to the cells and transport of carbon dioxide and waste from the cells. In addition, your cardiovascular system is important for the immune system, regulation of body temperature and transport of hormones. The cardiovascular system is divided into the lung circuit, which goes to the lungs and makes the blood take up oxygen, and the body circuit which provides oxygen to the cells in the body. This double circuit means that the blood passes through your heart twice per circuit in the cardiovascular system.

                        The main feature of the cardiovascular system is the heart, which is a muscle that has the task of transporting blood around the body by pumping. Your heart is connected to arteries and veins, where arteries transport blood from the heart out to the body and veins transport blood from the body to the heart. In addtition your heart is connected to coronary arteries that supply your heart muscle with oxygenated blood. <br /> <br />
                        Did you know that our heart beats about 100 000 times each day, and that if it stops beating for only a few second you will be unconscious? Your heart is the first functional organ that is made in vertebrates, and the heart has historically been seen as the centre of our bodies, as the seat of our emotions and even our intellect. Your heart has four cavities in which the blood that circulates your body run through. These cavities are called the left- and right atrium and left- and right ventricles. <br /> <br />
                        All the chambers are separated by heart valves that control that the blood only runs in the right direction, from the atriums to the ventricles, and from the ventricles to the big blood vessels. Your left atrium is supplied with oxygen-rich blood from the pulmonary veins, this blood then travels to the left ventricle which supplies blood for the main artery (aorta), making sure that oxygen-rich blood is provided for your body. Your right atrium is supplied with oxygen-poor blood form the body, this blood then travels to the right ventricle and then out through the pulmonary artery which leads to your lungs, where the blood cells again can collect oxygen. <br /><br />  
                        The beat of your heart is regulated by electrical impulses that starts in a node called the sinus node. The sinus node consists of specialised heart muscle cells that can rely an electrical impulse via specialised nerve fibres in your heart. The sinus node is also the origin of the normal heartbeat (sinus rhythm), because the impulses for heart contraction comes from the node. Your heartbeat can be disrupted by different heart rhythm disorders that make the heartbeat too fast or too slow. When your heart is beating too fast, a defibrillator can be used to knock out these rhythms so that the heart again can achieve sinus rhythm with the help of the sinus node. Further, your heartbeat is controlled by the need of oxygen in the body, with a faster heartbeat with increasing need for oxygen.

                <button class="expand-btn" onclick="toggleArticle('article2')">^ Specimen 11 - coronary bypass and heart attack</button>
                <div id="article2" class="article-content">
                    <p>
                        This artefact shows a wet specimen of a heart that has undergone a coronary bypass surgery, and also a fresh heart attack. A bypass surgery is a procedure that is done to lead the blood flow past an area of a blood vessel that is severely narrowed or entirely closed. In a vein- bypass, as done with this artefact, you take a vein from the leg and attach it to the aorta, that feeds the body oxygen-rich blood, as vell as a coronary artery, that provides oxygenated blood to the muscles of the heart. <br /> <br />
                        In the artefact, sutures from the surgery can be seen in the aorta and left auricle (structure on the left atrium). The sutures are from attachment to a heart-lung-machine that takes over the pumping function of the heart and the breathing function of the lungs. From the root of the aorta there are two vein-transplants that extend to branches of the left coronary artery.  <br /> <br />
                        Narrowed or closed blood vessels can be caused by atherosclerosis, the buildup of fats, cholesterol or other substances in and on the artery walls. A symptom of atherosclerosis could be angina pectoris, a kind of chest pain that feels like tightness in the chest and is caused by low blood supply to a part of the heart muscle. The pain could follow physical or mental stress. <br /> <br /> 
                        If the blood supply is completely cut off, the heart muscle won't have access to blood, and a heart attack occurs. This occurred with this heart, and a fresh heart attack can be seen in the anterior heart wall. The heart attack itself is caused by death of part of the heart tissue, following cut off blood supply. If a big enough part of the heart muscle is injured the heart won't be able to pump as well as earlier, this is termed as heart failure- and is what killed this patient. <br /> <br />
                        This heart belonged to a 63-year-old male who had been out of work for 4 years because of heart disease when he came in because of increasing angina pectoris. There was found significant atherosclerosis in coronary arteries. Because of this the patient had a coronary bypass surgery. On the first post-operative day he got chest pain and pulmonary edema, leaking of fluids from the vessels in the lungs out into the lung tissue. This was followed by asystole, which is lacking contraction of the heart muscle, that was successfully resuscitated. Two weeks later the patient died acute heart failure during picture examinations. <br /> <br />
                        The occurrence of heart attacks is connected to increasing age and in 2019 a little over 11 000 people in Norway got the diagnosis. There are more men than women that get diagnosed with a heart attack, and women are on average a bit older than men when coronary disease is discovered. The risk factors for a heart attack are connected to the risk of developing atherosclerosis, and the factors that one can control is life-style factors like diet, physical activity and smoking. In addition, genetics, as well as conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity could increase the risk.   </p>

                <div id="article3" class="article-content">
                    <p>
                        This artefact shows a corrosion casting of the coronary arteries that supply the heart muscles and associated connective tissue with blood. These arteries exist because the heart muscle, like all other tissues in the body, needs oxygen-rich blood to function. In addition, oxygen-depleted blood must be carried away. <br /> <br />
                        You have a right and left coronary artery that exit from your main artery (aorta) and on either side of your pulmonary artery. These arteries divide into small branches that go into your heart muscle. <br /> <br />
                        <img src="https://assets.heartfoundation.org.nz/images/heart-healthcare/coronary-artery-disease.png" alt="Description of the image">
                        The left coronary artery supplies blood to the left side of your heart muscle (left ventricle and atrium). The left coronary artery divides into branches: the left anterior descending artery that supplies blood to the front of the left side of your heart, and the circumflex artery that encircles your heart muscle and supplies blood to the outer side and back of your heart. The right coronary artery supplies blood to the right side of your heart (right ventricle and atrium) and in addition the some of the nodes that regulate the heart rhythm. Both the left anterior descending artery and the right coronary artery helps supply blood to your septum, a wall of tissue that separates the left and right sides of your heart and enables blood to flow as it should. The blood flow to the coronary arteries constitutes about 4% of your bodyÂ´s total blood flow. During physical exertion, blood flow to the coronary arteries can increase four to six times.

                        The artefacts on this row show different hearts, preserved with plastination, without specific abnormalities. As you can see, these hearts vary in size and shape. This is because how the insides of our bodies look are just as different as how we look on the outside. Generally, your heart is about the same size as your clenched fist. <br /> <br />
                        There are also differences between the average heart of men and women. For example, an average female heart is smaller and have smaller chambers then the male counterpart. There are also differences in density where some chambers are thinner, and the veins finer in female hearts. When it comes to function the female heart pumps faster than a male heart, but the male heart ejects more blood per pump.  Females exposed to stress will experience an increased heartrate, while males will experience an increase in blood pressure due to arteries constricting. <br /> <br />
                        The size of your heart can also be affected by lifestyle choices, heart disease and heart damage. Generally, any disease that makes your heart work harder can enlarge it. As the heart is a muscle, it grows in size just as arm muscles do when they have to work harder. Short term stress on the body, for example pregnancy, could also cause the heart to get larger. Depending on the condition, the heart may return to normal or stay enlarged. In the case of pregnancy, the enlarged heart may return to normal once the pregnancy is over. <br /> <br />
                        The picture shows the differences between an average human heart, and one enlarged by alcoholism and high blood pressure. Being covered in scar tissue, the bigger heart is nearly the double size of the average heart. This increase in heart size because of alcohol abuse weakens the heart so that its unable to pump blood adequately.
